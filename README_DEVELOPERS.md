  * ex: \scripts\common to find file: AccountCommands.pyc
* Extract relevant file to temporary folder, or exctract all files from a spesific folder
* Decompile relevant files from the temporary folder using uncompyle6 from command line
  * ex: uncompyle6 -o .\AccountCommands.py .\AccountCommands.pyc
* Add the decompiled py-files to the same folder as the mod
* Compile with: python -c "import mod_BRR;"

  * Expected result:
    ```
